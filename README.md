* [How to create this `django-starter` repository](./notes/01_how_to_create_this_repository.md)


## **IMPORTANT**
* This example repository has the Django [`SECRET_KEY`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/settings/#secret-key) revealed in [`settings.py`](). It is important in actual production projects to not push the actual `SECRET_KEY` to remote public repositories. There are ways to set this up which are beyond the scope of this document. One example, though, is used in [`settings`](https://github.com/brucestull/DjangoCustomUserStarter/tree/main/my_current_project/settings) directory which is part of [brucestull's DjangoCustomUserStarter](https://github.com/brucestull/DjangoCustomUserStarter).
    * One method to solve this issue is provided at [Configuring Django Settings for Production - thinkster.io](https://thinkster.io/tutorials/configuring-django-settings-for-production)
